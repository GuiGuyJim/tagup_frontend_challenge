#### Known Limitations and Considerations
Project only designed and manually tested on 'desktop sized' (~ 1024 X 768 +) screens  
'Fluid Layout' to accomodate moderate screen size changes needs some work still  
Code linting needs to be re-configured, so currently is selectively disabled  
Unit test coverage is minimal  
Project not tested with a mobile device or with touch input  
Project only manually tested with these browsers: Firefox (v.78.0.2) on Linux  
We're importing the entire BootstrapVue component set; this causes performance warnings for the production build.
Likely those warnings could be eliminated via using BoostrapVue in a different way.
See: [BootstrapVue's Getting Started documentation, especially smaller bundles](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs).
